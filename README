This is the stub for a fun and functional haskell graph library that takes care
of all the pesky details. I aim to build a simple frontend to various useful
graph algorithms from other packages.

Examples:
    Construct a graph from edges:
        fromEdges [("cat","dog"),("dog","cat"),("pig","pig")]
    
    Nodes need not have any edges:
        addNode "crocoduck" $ fromEdges [("crocodile","duck")]

Todo:
    weighted graphs
    graph algorithms (none in here just yet)

Annoying details such as node IDs are hidden away.
If these details are important, use Data.Graph.
